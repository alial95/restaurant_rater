# restaurant_rater

An application that allows the user to view the best and worst rated restaurants/establishments in their city or postcode, 
based on food safety inspections carried out by the UK GOV.
Future Plans:
- Expand the test base
- Offer more detailed analysis and information for the user
- allow the user to persist data in a mongoDB database
- increase the UIX by developing the tkinter layout
